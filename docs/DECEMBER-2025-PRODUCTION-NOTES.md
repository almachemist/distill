## Week 49 (Dec 1-7): Coffee Liqueur Bottling

**Activity:** Bottling Run  
**Product:** Coffee Liqueur  
**Priority:** HIGH - Holiday season demand  
**Notes:**
- Full week dedicated to bottling
- Priority bottling for holiday season sales
- No distillation this week

---

## Week 50 (Dec 8-14): Navy Strength Gin - Small Batch

**Activity:** Distillation
**Product:** Navy Strength Gin
**Batch:** 1/1 (standalone small batch)
**Equipment:** **Simini still (20L capacity)**
**Receiving Tank:** **None - Direct bottling**

### Important Notes:
- **This is a 20L batch in the Simini still, NOT the main still**
- **For 200ml bottles ONLY**
- **No tank storage** - Hearts collected and bottled directly
- This is a micro-batch to fill small bottle inventory
- Does not count toward main production schedule
- Uses small still to avoid tying up main distillation equipment
- **Does not use T-400 or any storage tank** - too small for tank storage

## Week 51 (Dec 15-21): Merchant Mae White Rum - Batch 1/3

**Activity:** Distillation  
**Product:** Merchant Mae White Rum  
**Batch:** 1/3 (first of three-batch cycle)  
**Equipment:** Main still  
**Receiving Tank:** T-330-A  

### Important Notes:
- **This is Batch 1/3 of the White Rum production cycle**
- Because this batch is produced in December 2025, the 2026 calendar only shows:
  - Batch 2/3 (Week 15, April 2026)
  - Batch 3/3 (Week 17, April 2026)
- Batch numbering follows **chronological production order**, not calendar year
- This batch adds 585 bottles to starting stock for 2026 planning

---

## Week 52 (Dec 22-28): Spiced Rum Bottling

**Activity:** Bottling Run  
**Product:** Spiced Rum  
**Notes:**
- Small amount of Spiced Rum remaining in tank from previous batch
- Bottling during holiday period (light operations)
- Clears tank for 2026 production

---

## Impact on 2026 Production Calendar

### Batch Numbering
- **Merchant Mae White Rum:** 2026 shows Batch 2/3 and 3/3 (not 1/3)
- **Navy Strength Gin:** December batch does not affect 2026 main production

### Starting Stock
- White Rum starting stock for 2026 includes the December 2025 batch (+585 bottles)
- This reduces the number of batches needed in 2026 from 3 to 2

### Equipment Notes
- **Simini still:** Used for small batches (20L) for 200ml bottles only
- **Main still:** Used for regular production batches (200-300L)
- The Simini still allows small specialty batches without disrupting main production schedule
